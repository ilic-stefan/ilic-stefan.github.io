    <h1> Hi, I'm Stefan Ilic&#769. </h1>

    <p> 
        I’m a recent college graduate who is passionate about mathematics 
        and interested in starting a career in software engineering.
    <br>
        I’m excited to create software products that solve problems
        for people.

        <ul>
            <li>
                Contributed to an ongoing Ruby on Rails app to create 
                a data visualization tool to meet the needs of an 
                external client (careers office)
           </li>

            <li>
                Wrote tests and fixed errors for main controller 
                in legacy code base (14 previous developers); 
                my changes increased test coverage on all files 
                from 55% to 73%
            </li>

            <li>
                Rebuilt form for creating/editing charts to reflect 
                new variable semantics I defined with the client 
                to better match the target, non-technical users 
                &rarr; qualitatively better user experience 
            </li>

            <li>
                Practiced reading code from other developers past 
                and present, coordinating with a team of varying 
                skill levels, and communicating with external 
                partners in a remote work setting
            </li>

    <p> 
   <em> Why my education is great preparation for software engineering:</em>
        <br>
        Through the Math major, I've developed excellent logical reasoning
        skills which give me an eye for 
        <ul>
            <li> deriving provable consequences of logical systems </li>
            <li> finding logical errors with proof. </li>
        </ul> 
        
        For my CS major, I learned the fundamental building blocks of 
        great software development:
        <ul>
            <li> data structures </li> 
            <li> object-oriented, imperative, and functional
                paradigms for manipulating data structures. </li>
        </ul>

        All CS majors can write solid, working code.
        But making large and complex applications 
        that are reliable and extendable requires logical
        reasoning skills that often come from studying really difficult
        abstract mathematics or physics.
